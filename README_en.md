   ```

3. **Configuration File**
   Create a `config.yaml` file in the `configs/` directory and fill in the following content:
   ```yaml
   appid: "your QQ bot development AppID"
   secret: "your QQ bot development AppSecret"
   openai_secret: "OpenAI API key (you can use other service providers as well)"
   openai_model: "gpt-4o-mini"
   openai_api_url: "OpenAI API URL (you can use other service providers as well)"
   admin_id: "your identifier"
   ```
   *If you're unsure how to configure this, please see the [Configuration Guide](#configuration-guide).*

4. **Start the Bot**
   Run the following command to start the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Bot

After starting, AmyAlmond will automatically connect to the specified group chats and begin working. You can configure the QQ developer platform sandbox or publicly release and invite the bot to the relevant group chats.

Users can trigger conversations by @mentioning the bot and receive context-based smart replies.

### Administrator Commands

- **@your bot restart**: Restart the bot, reloading all configurations and data (2-4 seconds).
- **@your bot reload**: Hot-load configuration files without restarting to apply the latest configuration changes (1-2 seconds).

*If these commands do not work, ensure that you have configured `admin_id`.*

### Message Handling and Memory

- **User Recognition**
  When a user first @mentions the bot, AmyAlmond will prompt the user to enter a nickname and record it in the `data/user_names.json` data table, ensuring that the nickname can be recognized and used in subsequent conversations.

- **Context Management**
  The bot automatically saves conversation context and generates the most appropriate response for the current conversation. It will also compress context combinations when sending messages to minimize tokens.

- **Long-Term Memory Processing**
  The bot can record and reference information from long-term memory at appropriate times. We recommend adding the following to your `configs/system-prompt.txt` for optimal results:
  ```text
  * You have built-in tools. You can use <get memory> to retrieve your previous memories, and you must use <memory>content</memory> to store memories when you think they are important.
  ```

### Log Management

All logs are recorded in the `logs` folder, containing detailed information about the bot's operation, which is useful for debugging and monitoring.
Here is the translation of the provided Chinese document into English using Markdown format:


## Configuration Guide

### 1. Obtain QQ Bot Development AppID and AppSecret

The QQ bot requires registration and configuration through the QQ Developer Platform to obtain an `AppID` and `AppSecret`. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Register a QQ Developer Account**
   - Visit the [QQ Developer Platform](https://q.qq.com/ and log in with your QQ account.
   - If you do not have a developer account, follow the instructions to complete the developer verification.

2. **Create an Application**
   - After logging in, click on **"Management Center"** in the top right corner to access the application management page.
   - Click the **"Create Application"** button.
   - Select the **"QQ Bot"** type of application and fill in the necessary application information, such as the application name and description.
   - Upon successful creation, the system will generate a unique `AppID` and `AppSecret` for your application.

3. **Retrieve the AppID and AppSecret**
   - On the application management page, click on the application you just created.
   - Under the **"Basic Information"** section of the application, you will find the `AppID` and `AppSecret`.
   - Copy these two values into the corresponding fields in the `config.yaml` file.

### 2. Obtain the OpenAI API Key and API Address

If you choose to use OpenAI's GPT models as the core conversational engine for your bot, you need to obtain the OpenAI API key and API address. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Register an OpenAI Account**
   - For users within China, you can use [openai-hk](https://openai-hk.com/?i=10138), which does not require a scientific internet connection setup and is fully compatible.
   - If your network environment allows, visit the [OpenAI Official Website](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and register an account.
   - If you already have an account, log in directly to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/login).

2. **Create an API Key**
   - After logging in, visit the [API Keys Page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - Click the **"Create New Secret Key"** button to generate a new API key.
   - Copy and securely save the generated key, as it will only be displayed once.

3. **Retrieve the API Address**
   - The default API address for OpenAI is `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
   - If you are using another provider's API, refer to their documentation to find the corresponding API address.

4. **Fill in the Configuration File**
   - Enter the generated API key in the `openai_secret` field in the `config.yaml` file.
   - Enter the API address in the `openai_api_url` field in the `config.yaml` file.

### 3. Obtain the Administrator Identifier

The administrator identifier is typically your account's identifier in the Python SDK, used for executing administrative commands in the bot.

 **Obtain Your QQ Identifier**
   - Ensure you have properly configured other settings. Then run the bot.
   - In a group, @mention the bot and send any message.
   - Check the console for the identifier associated with your sent message (e.g., 484294135BF695D**************).
   ```text
   [INFO]	(main.py:155)on_group_at_message_create	Received message: 'HI' from user: Message from unknown user: (484294135BF695D**************) in group: 2D17A7F4842C08B33**********
   ```
   - Enter the identifier into the `admin_id` field in the `config.yaml` file.

### 4. Configuration File Structure

Create a file named `config.yaml` in the `configs/` directory and fill it out according to the following format:

```yaml
appid: "your QQ bot development AppID"
secret: "your QQ bot development AppSecret"
openai_secret: "OpenAI API key (or other service provider)"
openai_model: "gpt-4o-mini"
openai_api_url: "OpenAI API URL (or other service provider)"
admin_id: "your identifier"
```

#### Example Configuration File

```yaml
appid: "1234567890abcdef"
secret: "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
openai_secret: "sk-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
openai_model: "gpt-4o-mini"
openai_api_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
admin_id: "4842941B3A42C08B331CEB3DD464"
```

### 5. Verify the Configuration

After configuring, verify the configuration with the following steps:

1. **Check YAML Syntax**
   - Ensure the `config.yaml` file has correct formatting and indentation. YAML is sensitive to indentation, and incorrect indentation can cause the configuration file to fail parsing.

2. **Start the Bot**
   - Start the bot using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - During startup, the bot will attempt to connect to QQ and the OpenAI API. If the configuration is correct, you will see a success message in the console.

3. **Review Logs**
   - After starting the bot, if there are connection issues or other errors, check the log files in the `logs` folder. The log files contain detailed error information to help you identify problems.

## FAQ

- **Bot Does Not Respond After Configuration**
  - Ensure that the `appid` and `secret` are correctly filled in and that your application is enabled on the QQ Developer Platform.
  - Check whether the correct permissions are assigned to your application on the QQ Developer Platform.

- **Bot Cannot Connect to the OpenAI API**
  - Verify that the `openai_secret` and `openai_api_url` are correctly filled in.
  - Ensure that the API key is valid and not exceeding usage limits. You can check usage on the [OpenAI Console](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).

- **Administrative Commands Do Not Work**
  - Make sure that the `admin_id` is correctly filled in and that the QQ number you are using matches the administrator identifier in the configuration.

- **How to Switch to Another LLM Provider**
  - If you do not want to use OpenAI, replace the `openai_api_url` and `openai_secret` with the API address and key of another LLM provider. Refer to the documentation of the respective provider for specific configuration methods.
